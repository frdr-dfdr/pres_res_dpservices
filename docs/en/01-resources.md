# Resources for Researchers
Last updated: 2026-02-06

Below are resources developed by Digital Preservation Services for researchers. These resource will be expanded as need. If you have a resource you would like to see developed, email preservation@frdr-dfdr.ca and we will review the request.

## Digital Preservation Basics
|Activity|Description|
|:-------|:----------|
|Planning and Documentation|Planning and documentation are key components of a digital preservation program. Digital preservation planning can include risk analysis, program benchmarking, and format strategies. Documentation can include digital preservation policies, frameworks, and workflows.|
|Metadata|Metadata is information that provides context about the digital files. Metadata for digital preservation includes information needed to manage the digital files over time. This information can be contextual, historical or technical in nature.|
|Fixity Checking|Fixity checking is a method that involves verifying that the file has not been altered or changed. This ensures that the integrity of the file is maintained. A common way to conduct fixity checking is to use checksums, a unique alpha-numerical sequence, that identifies the file.|
|Refreshing|Refreshing is a method that involves copying digital content from one storage medium to another storage medium of the same type. During this process there is no change to the bitstream of the file. Storage media refresh needs to occur to address storage decay or obsolescence. It is one component of a successful digital preservation program.|
|Replication|Replication is a method that involves ensuring that multiple copies of the digital files are stored in different geographic locations to mitigate loss in the event of a disaster, (fire, flood, system failures, cyberattack, etc.)|
|Migration|Migration involves transforming data from one format to a newer version of the same format. It may also involve the migration of a file to a different format to ensure continued access.|
|Normalization| Normalization involves converting copies of the original files to a select few non-propriety and widely available and used formats.|

## Digital Preservation for Research Data
Preservation consideration for your data can begin as early as the planning phase
of your research project. The preservation considerations at the planning phase can
be supplied to a repository to help the repository determine preservation activities
for your dataset.

### Does my data have long term value?
Consider how your data can be reused in the future by you and by others.
- Does the data need to be used for verification purposes?
- Will the data be used for future research and analysis?
- Does the data communicate and contribute to current and emerging knowledge and perspectives in your field?
- Will the data be used for learning and teaching?
- How valuable is the data in communicating current knowledge and perspectives?
- Does the data demonstrate potential ongoing social, scientific or historical
value?

### Does the data need to be kept for funder or policy compliance?
Consider any legislation, policy or funding requirements that may dictate what
data needs to be kept and potentially for how long.
- Does any legislation apply to your data?
- Is the data used in a patent application?
- Do agreements state or imply that data must be retained?
- Are there disciplinary regulations that require data to be kept?

### What data should be kept?
Consider if all the data you have generated needs to be kept or only part of it.
- Are the collection methods, processing methods, and the nature of the data documented?
- Is the data unique (there is only one complete copy of the data)?
- Is the data expected to be kept by the community?
- Do people, (funders, research groups, colleagues), expect this data will remain available for a long time?
- Will the data be superseded or available in another form?

## File Format Guidance for Researchers
The table below provides general guidelines for researchers outlining the differences between proprietary and open formats. In general, open formats are encouraged as the probability of continued access and reuse is higher. However, not all research can use open formats.

| Open formats | Proprietary formats | Proprietary, but open | 
|:-----------|:----------- |:----------- |
| No restrictions on use. Format specification freely available | Owned and controlled by a company | Proprietary, but the specification may be published (in whole or part) |
| Can be correctly read by a range of different software programs. Fully functional in at least one free software | Typically  requires proprietary software to read files reliably | Freeware options to visualize or analyze files, but may not have full functionality |
| Often an open standard, maintained by non-commercial expert body | Format description confidential, and subject to change at any time | Format description subject to change at any time, controlled by company |
| .csv, .txt, .mzml, .cif, .hdf5, .dcm, .fasta, .tiff, .jpg | .qgd, .fid, .dld, .spm, .wiff., accdb, .xls | .mat, .nb, .xlsx., .shp |
