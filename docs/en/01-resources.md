## File Format Guidance for Researchers
The table below provides general guidelines for researchers outlining the differences between proprietary and open formats. In general, open formats are encouraged as the probability of continued access and reuse is higher. However, not all research can use open formats.

| Open formats | Proprietary formats | Proprietary, but open | 
|:-----------|:----------- |:----------- |
| No restrictions on use. Format specification freely available | Owned and controlled by a company | Proprietary, but the specification may be published (in whole or part) |
| Can be correctly read by a range of different software programs. Fully functional in at least one free software | Typically  requires proprietary software to read files reliably | Freeware options to visualize or analyze files, but may not have full functionality |
| Often an open standard, maintained by non-commercial expert body | Format description confidential, and subject to change at any time | Format description subject to change at any time, controlled by company |
| .csv, .txt, .mzml, .cif, .hdf5, .dcm, .fasta, .tiff, .jpg | .qgd, .fid, .dld, .spm, .wiff., accdb, .xls | .mat, .nb, .xlsx., .shp |
